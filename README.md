   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On Unix or MacOS:

   ```ls
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project**

   Now you can run the project easily by click on the run all button in the jupyter notebook

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Wrangling**
    
   The first step of the project is to clean and prepare the data for analysis. The data wrangling process includes:

   - Handling missing values
   - Handling duplicate values
   - Handling incorrect data types
   - Handling outliers
   - Handling inconsistent data
   - Handling data redundancy
   - Handling data normalization

2. **Exploratory Data Anlaysis**

    The second step of the project is to explore the data and extract meaningful insights. The exploratory data analysis process includes:
    
    - Order Analysis
    - Product Analysis
    - Payment Analysis
    - Customer Analysis
    - Reviews Analysis
    - Sellers Analysis

3. **Data Visualization**
   
    The third step of the project is to visualize the data and extract meaningful insights. The data visualization process includes:
    
    - Product Category with most outstanding reviews given by customers
    - Visualize OTD(On Time Delivery) rate of orders
    - Visualize the demographics of customers
    - Visualize the frequency of purchases made by customers
    - Visualize the monetary value of purchases made by customers
    - Visualize the recent purchases made by customers
    - Visualize the customers segmentation based on RFM analysis
  
4. **Dashboard**

    The last step of the project is to create a dashboard that can be used to visualize the data and extract meaningful insights. The dashboard includes:
    
    - Product Category sales performance
    - Daily sales performance
    - Features
        Interactive Filters: Filter data by city, customer segment, and date range through an intuitive sidebar.

        Predictive Analytics:
        
        Predict total order price based on input features like freight value and price.
        
        Estimate delivery time using a Random Forest Regressor.
        
        Classify review scores using a Random Forest Classifier.
        
        Monthly Sales Forecasting: Utilize an LSTM model to forecast sales for the upcoming month.
        
        Data Export: Download prediction results in CSV or Excel formats.
        
        Dark Mode UI: Enhanced user interface with a dark theme for better readability

## 📈 Dashboard Explanation

Follow these steps to run the dashboard on your local machine:

1. **Run the Streamlit app**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the Streamlit app using the following command:

   ```sh
   streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit server and open a new page in your default web browser with the URL of the Streamlit app.

- **Explore the charts**

   The dashboard includes two charts: Sales by Product Line and Sales by Day. These charts provide a visual representation of the sales data based on your filter selections.Predictive Analytics:

                Predict total order price based on input features like freight value and price.

                Estimate delivery time using a Random Forest Regressor.

                Classify review scores using a Random Forest Classifier.
